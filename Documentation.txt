## 1. Introduction
The **AI Environmental Impact Analyzer** is a fully decentralized Web3 application designed to calculate and present the environmental impact of consumer goods. By leveraging blockchain technology, decentralized AI computation, and decentralized storage, the application ensures transparency, trust, and data sovereignty. Users can analyze product footprints, access tokenized incentives, and explore eco-friendly alternatives.

---

## 2. System Architecture
### Overview
The system is divided into three main layers:
- **Frontend**: Decentralized user interface for data input and result visualization.
- **Blockchain Layer**: Smart contracts for transparency and tokenized rewards.
- **Decentralized Storage and Computation**: For AI processing and secure data storage.

### Components
1. **Frontend**
   - Built with React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS.
   - Web3.js/Ethers.js for blockchain interaction.
2. **Blockchain**
   - Ethereum/Polygon for smart contracts.
   - Token-based incentives for eco-friendly actions.
3. **Decentralized Storage**
   - IPFS/Filecoin for storing analysis reports.
   - Ceramic Network for user data.
4. **Decentralized AI**
   - Computation handled via Fetch.ai or similar frameworks.

---

## 3. Features
### Core Features
- **Product Description Analysis**: Decentralized AI evaluates product details.
- **Manufacturing Data Insights**: Calculates emissions and energy usage.
- **Supply Chain Assessment**: Tracks carbon footprints in supply chains.
- **Environmental Footprint Score**: A blockchain-stored score for transparency.

### Additional Features
- **Eco-Friendly Suggestions**: Alternatives to reduce impact.
- **Web3 Authentication**: Wallet-based logins (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect).
- **Tokenized Rewards**: Incentives for eco-friendly actions.

---

## 4. Tech Stack
### Frontend
- **React.js**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Web3.js / Ethers.js**

### Blockchain
- **Ethereum / Polygon**

## 5. Installation and Setup
### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm
- MetaMask (or equivalent Web3 wallet)
- IPFS CLI (optional)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kaeytee/Ai-Environmental-Impact-Analyzer.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd ai-environmental-impact-analyzer
   ```
3. Install dependencies for the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```
4. Deploy smart contracts:
   - Configure the contract deployment script in `hardhat.config.js`.
   - Run:
     ```bash
     npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
     ```
5. Configure environment variables for Web3 and IPFS.
6. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## 6. Application Workflow
1. **User Input**: Users log in via Web3 wallet and input product details.
2. **AI Processing**: Decentralized AI analyzes data to calculate environmental scores.
3. **Blockchain Storage**: Scores are stored on-chain for transparency.
4. **Recommendations**: Users receive actionable insights and eco-friendly alternatives.
5. **Token Rewards**: Users earn tokens for eco-friendly choices.

---

## 7. Smart Contract Details
### Functionalities
- **Data Storage**: Store environmental scores and user data on-chain.
- **Tokenization**: Reward users with tokens for eco-friendly actions.
- **Verification**: Immutable records for transparency.

### Key Contracts
- **ImpactScore.sol**: Handles environmental scores.
- **EcoRewards.sol**: Manages token distribution.
- **UserData.sol**: Stores user-related information.

---

## 8. AI Model Details
- **Training Data**: Decentralized datasets on emissions and manufacturing.
- **Algorithm**: Fine-tuned transformers for NLP.
- **Decentralized Inference**: Runs on Fetch.ai or Golem nodes.

---

## 9. Decentralized Data Storage
